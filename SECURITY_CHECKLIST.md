**Status:** SECURE ✅

---

- [x] ✅ Path prefix stored in Result object
- [x] ✅ Index stored alongside UTXOs
- [x] ✅ Mempool-spent UTXOs filtered out
- [x] ✅ Address derivation follows BIP44 standard

- [x] ✅ No private key exposure during discovery

**Status:** SECURE ✅

---

### 3. UTXO Mapping Structure (Lines 172-185)

**Status:** SECURE ✅

---

### 4. Private Key Lookup (Lines 231-238)

- [x] ✅ Uses two-factor matching (txid + vout)
- [x] ✅ Throws error if key not found
- [x] ✅ Independent lookup for each input
- [x] ✅ No shared state between lookups
- [x] ✅ P2PKH unlock template correctly applied
- [x] ✅ SIGHASH_ALL used (prevents malleability)

**Status:** SECURE ✅

---

### 5. Transaction Signing (Lines 240-241)

- [x] ✅ No private key logging
- [x] ✅ Fail-fast on errors

**Status:** SECURE ✅

---

- [x] ✅ Not affected by UI state changes
- [x] ✅ Verified by Test 8

**Status:** PROTECTED ✅

---

### UTXO Collision
- [x] ✅ Array structure handles multiple UTXOs
- [x] ✅ Two-factor matching prevents collisions
- [x] ✅ Verified by Test 3

**Status:** PROTECTED ✅

---

### Mempool Double-Spend
- [x] ✅ Filtered during discovery phase
- [x] ✅ isSpentInMempoolTx check (line 119)

**Status:** PROTECTED ✅

---

### Seed Derivation Inconsistency
- [x] ✅ Identical derivation both phases
- [x] ✅ Verified by Test 6

**Status:** PROTECTED ✅

---

### Wrong Key Signing
- [x] ✅ Fails signature verification
- [x] ✅ Verified by Test 3 (negative test)
- [x] ✅ Cryptographically enforced

**Status:** PROTECTED ✅

---
